## About Myself

I am a young full-stack developer. I have experience with modern technologies such as Next.js, React, NestJS, Ruby on Rails, and Laravel, which has allowed me to create innovative solutions for both front-end and back-end.

Additionally, I have worked with relational databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB, and I have knowledge in implementing containers with Docker and cloud services with AWS. I am always looking for new challenges that motivate me to learn and contribute effectively in multidisciplinary teams.
